    "This is Module 4 in building a reusable, class-based machine learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Module 1](https://github.com/threnjen/object_oriented_machine_learning/blob/main/module1/module_1.ipynb), we focused on preparing to code outside of Jupyter Notebook. We set up virtual environments with [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), installed and configured [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and added automatic [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting to our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Module 2](https://github.com/threnjen/object_oriented_machine_learning/blob/main/module2/module_2.ipynb), we refreshed about how to build Python classes. We built our base model class with an initial exploratory method. We added docstrings to our class methods so that we get documentation when calling help().\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Module 3](https://github.com/threnjen/object_oriented_machine_learning/blob/main/module3/module_3.ipynb), we built an EDA Cleaning class and integrated it into our Base Model.\n",

    "In Module 4, we will focus on the following skills:\n",
    "- Understanding the concept of an abstract class\n",
    "- Setting up a Regression abstract class\n",

    "\n",
    "While a class is a blueprint for different similar objects, an abstract class is a blueprint for other classes. We use an abstract class if we're going to have functions that we ALWAYS want as part of our class, and that we want to use the SAME NAMES, but the function may have *different behavior*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example, and in fact the one we will use in our framework, is regression vs classification. In both of these model types we'll want to use train_trest_split to break up our data, but we might want to approach that differently depending on the model type. However we would like to be able to call the same method name to accomplish the task. Another example would be making a basic model - linear regression vs logistic regression, respectively. We can call a method named basic_model to accomplish this task, but have it use the correct type of model depending on our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to turn our BaseModel into a class blueprint (an abstract class) and define two methods - a split method and a basic regression method. However we will define the methods as abstract methods, meaning that the classes we make from the blueprint MUST use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to redefine our BaseModel as a class blueprint by making it an abstract class. We have a new import statement, and importantly, our BaseModel class declaration is now class BaseModel(ABC) which defines it as a class blueprint.\n"
